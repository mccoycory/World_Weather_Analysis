# World Weather Analysis

This project was all about using API to pull information quickly form the internet and be able the information for our users. During this project, we were building an application that allowed our users to seach vacation destinations based off of temp. We pulled the temp data from an open API source based on generated Lat & Longs. From the temp seach, we gave the user the nearest hotel recommendation using the gmaps API. Lastly, from the selected data, we also gave the users a driving route between cities. Below are some screenshots of the output of the code.
